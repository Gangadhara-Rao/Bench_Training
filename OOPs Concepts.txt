OOPs Concepts:
Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. 
Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.

1.Object
2.Class
3.Inheritance
4.Polymorphism
5.Abstraction
6.Encapsulation

1.Object:
Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc.

2.Class
Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.
Class doesn't consume any space.

3.Inheritance:
When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance.

4.Polymorphism
If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism.
ex:me-wife
me-mother
me-children

5.Abstraction:
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. 
For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.

6.Encapsulation:
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation. 
For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
